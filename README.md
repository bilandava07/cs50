# My CS50 Journey 

This repository marks the very beginning of my computer science journey. At the time, I was intensively learning German, as I only had one year to prepare for my studies at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. I was very curious about software development, and a good friend of mine recommended **Harvard’s online CS50 course**. Since then, I spent most of my free time working through this amazing course. 
It was very challenging, as I had **no previous programming experience**. At the same time, those first steps instantly felt incredibly exciting and rewarding, which really sparked my passion for computer science. 

This repository is a collection of small programs I wrote for the course’s problem sets. Most of them are in **C**, which was the first programming language I learned. 

I solved lots of interesting problems and learned important concepts like **pointers** and the **fundamentals of memory management**, which gave me a solid foundation for understanding how programs actually work under the hood. 

Looking back, I now see that learning C as my first language was an extremely valuable experience. It taught me the basics of data structures, memory, and most importantly, how to solve problems using a language computers understand.
Later, when I started my university studies and transitioned to **Python**, it made everything much easier. By already understanding how things work at a low level in C, learning Python felt smooth and intuitive. 
Having implemented a lot of basic concepts and functions in C made me appreciate how much heavy work Python now did for me. However, it also sometimes made me struggle with very high level of abstraction I was not used to coming from C.

Even though I eventually stopped following the CS50 course when it moved fully into Python (I was already learning Python at university), this repo is a nice snapshot of my early programming journey and the skills I built from scratch in C.
