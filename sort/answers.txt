sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

The Bubble Sort is the only algorithm whose "big O" and "omega" differ.
In the course of the timing and analysis I found the "sort1" to be the only one whose
"big O" and "omega" indeed do not match.
Also the Bubble sort is supposed to be the most fastest in the best-case scenario and so is the "sort1".

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

The Merge Sort is considered to be the fastest in random and worst scenarios. In the course of the timing and analysis I
determined the "sort2" to be the fastest in those particular cases.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort
